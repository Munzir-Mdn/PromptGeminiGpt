Create a passport photo using this face 100% without any change.
The body and face must be facing the camera with clean studio lighting.
The background must be a solid blue colour exactly.
Put a formal blazer and a white collared shirt on him.
No tie.
Make sure the hair is neat and tidy.
Apply very light natural retouching only (no changes to facial structure).
Ensure the result follows standard passport-photo proportions.
