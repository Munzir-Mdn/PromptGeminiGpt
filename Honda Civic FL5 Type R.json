"action_input": "A high-resolution 8K photo shot from a high angle looking down. A man with short dark hair, black-rimmed glasses, and a small goatee—resembling the person in the provided image—is leaning casually against a modified Honda Civic FL5 Type R. The scene is set at night under the glow of a single warm streetlight, creating dramatic lighting and glimmering reflections on the car's polished surface. The man faces directly toward the camera with a calm, confident expression. Professional photography style, captured with a Canon EOS R5, 85mm lens, f/1.4, ISO 400, cinematic atmosphere."
